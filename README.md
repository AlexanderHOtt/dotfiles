# Ott's Dots

This is a collection of my dot (configuration) files.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderHOtt/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles

stow      # To use all
stow zsh  # To only use the zsh config
```

[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) creates a symlink relative to your home directory. That's why everything is nested 3 folders deep.
